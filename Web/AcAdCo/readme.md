# AcAdCo

AcAdCo is a tool for matching prospective and current PhD students with advisors and collaborators. 

Current visions is to have profiles of the Professors (collected from websites) and students (self created). 

Base version will allow the students look for advisors and collaborators.

More advanced version will allow for machine learning based matching, recommenders making recommendations to students based on their profiles. 

Base advisor profile:
1. Web based collection of the info (scan CS department website and professors personal web pages)
2. Include: research areas and topics, current and past students, publications, conferences, location, if they're currently hiring.
3. Advanced versions: Youtube videos or blog posts about past talks/workshops
4. Advanced versions: Feedback from past/current students (keep it neutral to the work style and not make it personal?)
5. Allow Professors to create a profile if it doesn't exist and/or modify their profile (based on authentication)
6. Advanced versions: RateMyProfessor info

Base student profile:
1. Students build their profile
2. Include: research areas and topics of interest, education, professional experiences, publications, projects, conferenced attended (to connect students in the future), affiliations, past collaborators, locations of interest, other resources (i.e. articles, videos, websites) 
3. Advanced: Parse resume



Advanced future steps:
    Profile: add companies and their research teams/scientists
    Backend:  Node.js or Django
    Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
    Authenticator: for students who create a profile and professors to confirm their autogenerated profile
    Algorithms:
        1. Base: Simple matching score calculator 
        2. Advanced: Machine Learning based matching algorithms (similarity score)
        3. Advanced: recommender system to suggest collaborators and advisors/advisees
