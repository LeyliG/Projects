# Causality



Causality research  - studying how different events/variables are related among themselves - can be split into two main branches/tasks: 
1. ***Causal discovery*** uses observational data to gain causal knowledge (whether different variables have a causal relationship).
2. ***Causal inference*** estimates the impact a change in a specific variable has on the outcome of interest (assumes a relatiosnhip between the variables and tests/quantifies the actual relationship).

Causal relationships are the probabilistic cause-and-effect relationsgips, where the effects of interventions/treatments (change on some variables) or hypothetical interventions (i.e. counterfactual claims) directly result in the occurence of an event/variable.

##### Note: Correlation does not imply causation and vice versa.

Kids ask a lot of ***Why*** questions which often is the cause of annoyance for parents.

This could be due to the fact that we are expected to use our existing knowledge, experiences, and habits we've developed as we age and mature. For most of adults acquiring new knowledge and experiences within concetrated fields become part of the societal/cultural norm (i.e. schools and new jobs). My simplified of view of causal research is to awaken an inner child and
